## JSON Parser in Java

this project is created out desperation for simple JSON parser. **Just a parser.**

I can use `Gson` or `Jackson` project but those are too big and clumsy.


Thank to Rob Pike for amazing talks about `Lexer` and `Parser` which helps me develop this parser. I suggest you to watch them.

Enjoy the Simplicity.

Cheers,
